Lexical Stemmer for Arabic Trilateral verbs root
# Concept:
#            - This is a lexical stemmer to extract Classical Arabic trilateral verbs stems as prescribed by IMAM IBN MALIK(1997).
#              This is according to Imam Baḥraq (1993) commentary on the above source i.e. IMAM IBN MALIK(1997).
#              To extent, Imam al Rifāʿī commentary thereof is sought as well i.e. al Rifāʿī (1983).
# 	         - The issue to underscore here is that; a taxonomy (definition of terminology) is necessary for the task, to avert repeating
#              deficincies, I perceived prevailing in the literature.
# OBJECTIVE:
#            -  Noteworthy, stemming and stemmers techniques are common topics in the studies 
#               of Linguistics, Morphology in particular. Reading a few papers on the subject, 
#	              I perceived a prevailing pattern. Rules postulated for the task are morphological i.e. 
#	              a rule is designed to handle specific segments (alphabets letters, such as common
#               affixes …etc.). I should do this in Python Documentation style, I figured,  as I could
#              not do that in academic one, albite many futail attempts. After all, testing is the crown-jewel here!
#	-  SO WHATS WRONG WITH STEMMERS IN THE LITERATURE???
