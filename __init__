This is motivated by McCarthy, (1981); a treatment of the nonconcatenative morphological system of Classical Arabic verbal system (Cl.Ar). 
Semitic languages processes of morphological derivation are characterised by a wide variety of purely morphological alternations internal to the verb stem
( its more of phonological alternations than morphological alternations ones).

Thus, Cl.Ar Morphological Categories are expressed by morphemes whose only constant is a fixed canonical pattern based on triplicity concept. (for accuracy sakes, the constant is the template's phonological
rules/patterns. In other words, contigous consonant-vowel segments e.g. in a CV.[CV].CV skelton. the conventional affixation system, as in
Indo-European languages, but  Indeed, this seaminglly simple trivil fact is the secret of the complixity of the whole system.
This project aims at explicating the system of predicates used to analyze inputs i.e. the possible structural descriptions of rules, and to define the operations
available for transforming inputs, the possible Structural Changes of rules. Ultimitly, a structural description delimiting a class of inputs and a Structural Change specifying
the operations that altered the input are sought.



/a/: A low, open vowel.
/i/: A high, front vowel.
/u/: A high, back vowel.
Vowels are characterized by their steady-state articulatory positions, serving as syllable nuclei.
