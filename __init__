This is motivated by McCarthy, (1981); a treatment of the nonconcatenative morphological system of Classical Arabic (Cl.Ar). 
In fact, Semitic languages morphological derivation processes are characterised by a wide variety of purely morphological alternations internal to the stem
(phonological alternations to be exact). As a result, Arabic morphological categories are expressed not expressed by the conventional affixation system, as in
Indo-European languages, but by morphemes whose only constant is a fixed canonical pattern. (for accuracy sakes, whose only constant is the template's phonological rules/patterns .i.e
contigous consonant-vowel segments e.g. in a CV.[CV].CV skelton. Indeed, this seaminglly simple trivil fact is the secret of the complixity of the whole system.
This project aims at explicating the system of predicates used to analyze inputs i.e. the possible structural descriptions of rules, and to define the operations
available for transforming inputs, the possible Structural Changes of rules. Ultimitly, a structural description delimiting a class of inputs and a Structural Change specifying
the operations that altered the input are sought.

Theory prosodic of nonconcatenative morphology

One of the classic linguistic issues is that of providing an account of the nonconcatenative 
morphological system prevailing in most members of the Semitic language family.

/a/: A low, open vowel.
/i/: A high, front vowel.
/u/: A high, back vowel.
Vowels are characterized by their steady-state articulatory positions, serving as syllable nuclei.

There is another class of data that is richly attested in Arabic and other Semitic 
languages. In the standard phonological theory, phonological rules that are restricted 
to some morpheme or morpheme class must refer to +-boundary and perhaps also to 
some set of morphological diacritic features. In a nonconcatenative system, + -boundary 
is clearly unavailable, so such rules could not be formulated. I present three cases of 
this sort below in support of the [-notation. These rules must, however, be taken as 
preliminary, since they would necessarily be rewritten in the light of the more elaborated 
analysis of Arabic (and Semitic) morphology in subsequent sections of this article. This 
consideration does not affect the argument

1.	Preliminaries.
A.	As principally conceived, the RULE of grammar was to be built from a Structural Description delimiting a class of inputs
and a Structural Change specifying the operations that altered the input Explicating the system of predicates used to analyze inputs; the possible structural 
descriptions of rules, and to define the operations available for transforming inputs, the possible Structural Changes of rules.
B.	In dispute still, is the character of well-formedness constraints interaction, the relation between such constraints and whatever 
derivational rules they are meant to influence.  Indeed, this our impedes understanding the basic functioning of the grammar. The key point 
to underscore here is the role of well-formedness constraints as involving a kind of conceptual crisis at the center of phonological thought. Indeed, 
any serious theory of phonology must rely heavily on well-formedness constraints; where serious means commitment to Universal Grammar. 

2.	The Task:

A.	To explicate the system of predicates used to analyze inputs in Classical Arabic; the possible Structural Descriptions of rules, and to define the operations
available for transforming inputs; the possible Structural Changes of rules.
B.	To establish a class of possible phonetic representation of Classical Arabic sentences by determining the universal set of phonetic features and the conditions
on possible phonetic representation possible combinations.
C.	The role of the representational well-formedness determines the assignment of grammatical structure, the character of the interaction among the posited well-formedness
constraints, as well as the relation between such constraints and whatever derivational rules they are meant to influence.

The Function proceeds as following:
-	Multiply Arabic consonants alphabet 28 * 28. A total of 784 single segments results from the multiplication. The result violates the Minimal-Root\Triplicity constraints
(forthcoming) i.e. a single segment dose not compose a verb root in Arabic.
-	Orthographically speaking, bilateral root verbs build is in order. Phonologically, this type of roots does not violate Triplicity constraints (Idgam). The task is accomplished 
by pairing segments resulting in a total combination of 392 pairs of orderly unique bilateral verbs. Furthermore, for each single pair, do make a reversed pair; hence, one unique orderly 
pair and one unique reversed pair. Mathematically, 392*392= 784.

-	At this point, a few statistics are in order. Do print the count of: strong bilateral roots (a root composed of two consonants i.e. no vowel). Do the same for weak roots( a consonant 
and a vowel). The count of pairs composed of identical segments e.g.  "د د". The count of pairs composed of two vowels.
